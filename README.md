# Leave-Application-Portal
The Leave Application Portal project aims to develop a streamlined, user-friendly online system for managing employee leave requests. This portal will allow employees to submit leave applications, track their leave balances, and view the status of their requests in real-time. 
Managers and HR will have access to an intuitive interface to review, approve, or reject leave applications, ensuring efficient workflow management.

The goal is to reduce administrative burden, improve transparency, and provide a seamless experience for all users involved in the leave management process.
